### What advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
#
Change what youâ€™re working on more often, staying on one thing can diminish your confidence if stuff keeps going wrong.

### Did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?
#
No, I didn't add the allies, character magic, and enemies moving toward the player.

### What was the hardest part of the project?
#
Changing the perspective, left and right to up, down, left, and right. Had to add wall collision, and change the code for the door.

## Were there any problems you could not solve?
#
the doors and walls do their jobs, but the small areas where the wall just doesn't work next to the door I was never able to fix.
