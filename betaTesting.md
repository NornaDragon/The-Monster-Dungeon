# Beta Testing

## Beta tester 1 (has comp. sci knowledge)
### Initial remarks
- It would not be obvious to some first-time players what the significance is of the boxes on the upper left-hand corner. It might make sense to label them
- It might also make sense to give the first-time player some indication of how to play the game. This could be on a splash-screen at the beginning, on the background, or maybe be brought up by pressing, say, F1. Another alternative would by a downloadable/printable instruction sheet.

### Playing the game
- If one knows the basic rules of using the arrow keys and the mouse left clicks, it seems quite easy to play the game
- For a right-handed person, it can take some getting used to control the arrow keys with the left hand and/or have to switch between the mouse and keyboard in rapid succession
- One does not seem to get life force back for killing a monster, which can make it hard to kill more than one or two monsters on a screen with multiple monsters
### Suggestions for possible future enhancements
- Add sound
- Provide more instructions
- Label the upper left buttons (and implement the functionality for the second button)
- Have a button on the YOU LOOSE screen allowing the player to play again, should they want to

### Over-all impression
Admittedly, I am a bit biassed but, despite some of the minor issue/suggestions that I mentioned, I’m impressed at what the programmer has achieved with relatively recent JavaScript coding skills. Bravo.

## Beta tester 2 (no/limited comp. sci knowledge)
### Initial remarks
- As a novice in computer games, I needed more than a few instructions from the programmer to start the game.
- However, post instructions, it was fairly easy to play.

### Playing the game
- Although it was fairly easy to play the game, I wasn’t able to get past the third “enemy”. My coordination between the arrows and the mouse just wasn’t fast enough.
### Suggestions for possible future enhancements
- More instructions on what is happening inside the game will be helpful.

### Over-all impression
As a complete novice, it is difficult for me to comment on the quality of the game, however, I enjoyed playing the game.
